# Home Decor Retail — Full Stack Data Analysis
This project analyzes a home décor retail dataset to understand the difference between high-revenue and high-profit categories.
Using sales, profit, returns, and customer behavior data, the analysis identifies furnishings (lamps) as a strategic driver of customer loyalty and sustainable profitability.
The project follows a full data analytics workflow — from data modeling and cleaning to business insights and visualization.

## Project Objective
The objective of this analysis is to help a retail brand move away from a “sell-everything” strategy and identify product categories that contribute to long-term business value — not just short-term revenue.

## Business Context

The retail chain completed a full financial year and wanted to reassess its product strategy.
While large furniture items generated high revenue, frequent losses due to returns and replacements raised profitability concerns.
This analysis focuses on furnishings — particularly lamps — to evaluate their role in profitability, customer retention, and brand recall for modern urban households.

## Key Business Questions
This analysis was guided by the following business questions:

1.How do sales and profit vary across major product categories?
2.Which categories generate revenue but erode profitability due to losses?
3.Are furnishings — particularly lamps — contributing to sustainable profit?
4.Do furnishings show signs of driving repeat customer engagement?
5.Which geographies perform best for profitable furnishing sales?
6.Where are losses concentrated, and what product characteristics drive them?
7.How can the brand refine its product mix to improve long-term performance?

## Dataset & Modeling Overview
This project is based on a retail home decor dataset covering sales, profit, customers, products, and geography across one financial year. 
Due to data structure limitations and quality constraints, the analysis required careful handling of:

Category and sub-category mapping

Profit and loss inconsistencies at order level

Customer-level aggregation for loyalty analysis

Geographic spread with uneven order volumes

Instead of treating revenue as the sole performance indicator, the dataset was modeled to evaluate:

Profit sustainability

Loss concentration patterns

Customer engagement signals

Strategic product performance

A visual-first analytical approach was used to translate these insights into clear business narratives.

## Key Insights

### 1. Revenue Alone Does Not Define Category Success
High-revenue categories such as tables and bookcases generated significant sales volume but also showed frequent negative-profit orders, resulting in substantial loss leakage.
This confirms that revenue-heavy categories can still weaken overall business performance when cost and return dynamics are ignored.

### 2. Furnishings (Lamps) Deliver Sustainable Profitability
Within the furnishings category, lamps emerged as a strategically strong product line:

Revenue: ₹21.9K

Profit: ₹3.87K

Profit Margin: 17.66%

Despite lower revenue compared to bulky furniture, lamps maintained consistent profitability, indicating healthier unit economics. 

The following snapshot highlights why furnishings—particularly lamps—play a strategic role despite lower overall revenue.

### 3. Lamps Act as a Customer Loyalty Anchor
Lamp purchases were associated with 124 unique buyers, including 17 repeat customers, signaling:

High refresh and replacement behavior

Emotional and lifestyle-driven buying decisions

Strong probability of repeat engagement

Unlike large furniture items purchased infrequently, lamps remain relevant across seasons and home refresh cycles.

### 4. Geographic Performance Is Uneven but Actionable
Lamp sales were distributed across multiple high-performing states, including:
California, New York, Texas, Florida, Illinois, and others.

This geographic spread enables:

Targeted regional promotions

Bundling strategies with larger furniture categories

Smarter inventory planning

### 5. Loss Concentration Reveals Operational Risk

Returns and replacements were concentrated in specific regions and were primarily linked to bulky furniture products, not furnishings.

This highlights:

Logistics and handling risks

Higher return costs for large items

Opportunity to offset losses using high-margin furnishings

## Strategic Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following strategies are recommended to maximize profitability while mitigating losses:

### 1. Bundle High-Margin Furnishings with High-Revenue Furniture
Promote lamps alongside tables and bookcases in high-performing states.
Bundling encourages cross-category purchases, increases average order value, and leverages the profitability of lamps to offset potential losses from bulky furniture.

### 2. Implement Pre-Order Policies for Large Furniture Items
Introduce pre-order or reservation options for tables and bookcases.
This reduces inventory risk, ensures product availability, and minimizes returns due to misalignment with customer expectations.

### 3. Customer Feedback for Product Refinement

Conduct surveys with new and returning customers on lamp preferences — size, shape, style, and durability.
Insights from feedback can inform design, inventory, and marketing strategies, enhancing customer satisfaction and repeat purchases.

### 4. Targeted Regional Promotions

Focus marketing campaigns on states showing high lamp profitability (e.g., California, New York, Texas).
Use geographic insights for inventory allocation and bundled offers, ensuring optimal supply-demand alignment.

### 5. Monitor Loss Concentration and Operational Risks

Track returns and replacements for bulky items, particularly in high-return regions.
Adjust logistics, handling, and return policies to minimize operational losses.

## Methodology / Approach

The analysis followed a structured, end-to-end data analytics workflow:

Data Cleaning & Modeling: Resolved inconsistencies in profit, returns, and product categorization; mapped categories and subcategories.

Full - Stack Analysis: Identified patterns in sales, profit, and losses across categories and geographies.

Customer-Level Aggregation: Analyzed repeat purchases and customer engagement to measure loyalty.

Geographic Analysis: Evaluated state-wise performance for targeted marketing and inventory planning.

Profit Sustainability Assessment: Focused on profitability patterns beyond revenue to highlight strategic product lines.

## Tools & Technologies Used

Excel / Power Query / Power Pivot: Data cleaning, modeling, and analysis

SQL: ETL, Data querying and aggregation

Power BI: Visualizations and dashboards

## Business Value

This project delivers actionable insights for the retail brand:

Shifts focus from revenue-only strategy to sustainable profitability.

Identifies high-margin, repeat-purchase products (lamps) for strategic promotion.

Reduces operational losses by highlighting risky product categories and regions.

Guides bundling strategies, pre-order policies, and customer feedback integration for product optimization.

## Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates how a data-driven approach can help retail brands move beyond revenue-centric strategies. By focusing on high-margin products like lamps, monitoring loss concentrations, and leveraging customer insights, the brand can enhance profitability, optimize inventory, and drive repeat engagement. The dashboard provides an at-a-glance view of key performance metrics, enabling informed decisions for sustainable growth.
